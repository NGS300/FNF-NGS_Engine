## Necessary to Build

### Installing the Required API Programs

First Step - Download Haxe Items
1. [Install Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/) (Download 4.1.5, I haven't tested if the latest version works)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe
3. haxelib install newgrounds

1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads) For Use Git Links
2. Run `haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git` to Install Polymod.
3. Run `haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc` to Install Discord RPC.
4. Run `haxelib git hxCodec https://github.com/polybiusproxy/hxCodec.git` to Install HXCodec.

### Compiling game API

Second Step - Download API or Addons (I don't know the name of it ;-;)

To run it from your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) it can be a bit more involved. For Linux, you only need to open a terminal in the project directory and run `lime test linux -debug` and then run the executable file in export/release/linux/bin. For Windows, you need to install Visual Studio Community 2019. While installing VSC, don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:

Download [Visual Studio Communty 2019](https://my.visualstudio.com/Downloads?q=visual%20studio%202019&wt.mc_id=o~msft~vscom~older-downloads) & Choice x64 or x86 Bit

## Compile FNF For .exe
Open Prompt Windows, Power Shell and If You're Lucky it's Visual Studio, For Compile.
* `lime test windows`
* `lime test linux`

You can run FNF from the .exe file under export\release\windows\bin
As for Mac, 'lime test mac -debug' should work, if not the internet surely has a guide on how to compile Haxe stuff for Mac.

* This Entire Installation Is 25-27GB Which You Will Need To Use From Your PC
